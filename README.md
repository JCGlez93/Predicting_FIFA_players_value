# Predicting FIFA players value

## **Overview:**
This instructions will allow you to make a copy of the project locally.\
Check test execution to understand how  to deploy  and execute the Model_for_app.ipynb. \
I have created 2 extra files as a bonus so you can understand better the machine learning models and make investment decisions

You can find the following executable files:

- Model_for_app.ipynb : explains the dataset, does a random forest regression and creates an app that allows you to get the value of a player based on certain parameters.
- Bonus.ipynb :  explains the dataset and does more complex machine learning models.
- under_rated_players.ipynb: explains the dataset, does a random forest regression and creates a csv with the value predicted vs reality. It includes a link to a tableau dashboard so you can interact with the list and take the best decision.

## **Pre-requisites:**

- Python 3.7 (at least)

- Sklearn 

- Pandas

- Seaborn

- Matplotlib

- os

- Time

- Conda

- Tkinter



## **Instalation:**

As a rule of thumb: I do encourage you to install conda, create a working environment and download any library (mentioned above) doing : "conda install..."

Example: "conda install numpy"

## **Test execution:**

Any execution must be done from a jupyter notebook so both the model and the app works perfectly.
The machine learning model will run automatically and after it has learned , you will be able to input data in the app.



## **Core technical concepts and inspiration**

The main reason why I created this project is to understand what makes a football player more expensive based on different skills.
Can we find the new Messi on his very early stages?

Jupyter notebooks are quite good to create and run the model as you can iterate and print the result easily.
To interact with the machine learning model , I have used tkinter as the main library.

## **Usage**

1- Run all the jupyter notebook\
2- An app will pop up, input the parameters based on the following intervals:


- Parameters: 

        - 'age' : 16-46
        - 'height_cm': 155-205
        - 'weight_kg': 49-110
        - 'overall': 44-94
        - 'potential : 44-95
        - 'wage_eur': 1000-565000
        - 'international_reputation': 1-5
        - 'weak_foot': 1-5
        - 'skill_moves': 1-5
        - 'team_jersey_number': 1-99
        - 'nation_jersey_number': 1-99
        - 'pace': 21-99
        - 'shooting': 14-93
        - 'passing': 20-93
        - 'dribbling': 22-96
        - 'defending': 14-90
        - 'physic': 27-92
        - 'year': 2015-2022
3- Press the button and you will get the time of the execution and the player value\
4- Known issues : the model does not accept blank inputs\
5- Limitation: the model does only accept numerical values coming from the dataset. Ideally you can use dummy variables to increase R2 but you will not be able to create a usable GUI


## **To Do**

- Better explore the player position as it will probably improve the understanding of the model
